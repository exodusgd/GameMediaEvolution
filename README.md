# GameMediaEvolution
A dynamic visualization of the evolution of videogame storage media, from cassette tapes to Blu-ray discs.

The code requires a Processing 4 installation (or compatible) to run. For a Windows (64-bit) build [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15jpuEmJMN-ECSxIuev5-bNuqIYYqfdjq/).

### Instructions
Using the slider below the tv screen you can control the amount of the displayed storage media. Once the total capacity of the displayed storage media reaches the next jump in technology, it starts displaying the following storage media. To go back to the previous media, just drag the slider to the left of its starting position.
